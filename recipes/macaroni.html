     <h3>Macaroni (/ˌmækəˈroʊni/)</h3>

     <p>known in Italian as <em>emmaccheroni</em>, is a pasta shaped like narrow tubes. Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as <em>"elbow macaroni"</em>.</p>
     <p>The word macaroni is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy and other countries, the noun maccheroni can refer to straight, tubular, square-ended pasta corta (lit. 'short pasta') or to long pasta dishes, as in maccheroni alla chitarra, which is prepared with long pasta such as spaghetti. In the United States, federal regulations define three different shapes of dried pasta (macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli) as falling under the label of "macaroni product".</p>

       <big><h3>FAQ</h3></big>

       <h3>Can you Make Macaroni Salad Ahead of Time?</h3>
       <p>Yes, macaroni salad makes a great make-ahead potluck dish. In fact, since the flavors need time to meld in the refrigerator, it might actually be better to make it a day or two in advance. </p>

       <h3>How Long Does Macaroni Salad Last?</h3>
       <p>This homemade macaroni salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. We don’t recommend freezing this recipe, as the noodles will likely become mushy after they are thawed.</p>
