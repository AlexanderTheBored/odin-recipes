     <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>When preparing spaghetti pasta for this Filipino Spaghetti, it’s important to add salt to the water before boiling. The salt enhances the flavor of the pasta as it cooks. Use about 1-2 tablespoons of salt for every 4-6 quarts of water.</li>
        <li>Make sure the water is at a full boil before adding the spaghetti noodles. This guarantees that the pasta cooks evenly and doesn’t become mush</li>

        <li>Saute the aromatics and ground pork. Heat the oil in a pan. Add the minced onions and garlic, and sauté them until the onions soften and become translucent. Once the onions and garlic are soft, add the ground pork to the pan. Brown the pork until it turns a light brown color. This browning process adds depth of flavor to the meat and helps top a richer taste</li>
